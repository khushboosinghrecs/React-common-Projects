Sure, let's break down each of these concepts related to React:

1. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** HMR is a feature that allows developers to update code changes in real-time without requiring a full page refresh. When you make changes to your React application code, HMR will detect these changes and inject the updated modules into the running application without losing the current state.

2. **Reconciliation in React:** Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI to match the new state of the application. When the state or props of a component change, React compares the new virtual DOM representation with the previous one and calculates the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM efficiently.

3. **How React Works:** React is a declarative, component-based library for building user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM to represent the UI, allowing it to efficiently update only the parts of the DOM that have changed. When the state or props of a component change, React re-renders the component and updates the virtual DOM. It then performs reconciliation to calculate the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

4. **Bundler:** A bundler is a tool that takes multiple JavaScript and CSS files, along with their dependencies, and bundles them together into a single file (or multiple files) that can be served to the browser. Bundlers like Webpack, Parcel, and Rollup are commonly used in React applications to handle module bundling, code splitting, and optimization.

5. **Babel:** Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code (ES6+ syntax) into a backward-compatible version of JavaScript that can run in older browsers. It allows developers to use the latest language features without worrying about compatibility issues. In React development, Babel is often used to transpile JSX syntax and other modern JavaScript features.

6. **Webpack:** Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It allows developers to bundle JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into a dependency graph, enabling features like code splitting, lazy loading, and hot module replacement. Webpack is often used in React applications to bundle and optimize the code for production deployment.

Behind the scenes, when you develop a React application, you write components using JSX syntax. These components are then transpiled by Babel into plain JavaScript. Webpack is used to bundle these JavaScript files, along with their dependencies, into a single bundle that can be served to the browser. During development, tools like HMR can be used to provide a smooth development experience by allowing code changes to be reflected instantly in the running application. Finally, React's reconciliation algorithm efficiently updates the DOM based on changes in the application state, ensuring a fast and responsive user interface.
